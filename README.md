## Download
FIW can be obtained from two primary locatiions: the main dataset (i.e., raw data, experimental splits, and more) [downloads page](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/fiw/download.html), along with task-specific data splits on codalab (i.e., [Task 1](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21843), [Task 2](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22117), and [Task 3](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22152)), which were at one time used for data challenge (i.e., [2020 RFIW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06303.pdf) in conjunction with the [IEEE FG Conference](https://fg2020.org/)). Oncce download, we suggest to decompress the files in the data to their own folder.

[Papers on FIW](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/fiw/publications.html) decribe the data collection processes and details; supplemental to this is the [FIW Data Card]("DatasheetForFiw/main.pdf") below. Note that the Latex source file for the datasheet could be borrowed as a tempalate for another dataset of similar structure. Check out [repo](https://github.com/visionjo/DatasheetForFIW/tree/master), as well as [DatasheetForFiw/main.pdf](DatasheetForFiw/main.pdf)

A more complete list of references can be found [here](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/fiw/publications.html).

### Structure
* *FIW_PIDs.csv:* Photo lookup table. Each row is an image instance, containing the following fields:
  * *PID:* Photo ID
  * *Name:* Surname.firstName (root reference for given family)
  * *URL:* Photo URL on web
  * *Metadata:* Text caption for photo
  
* *FIW_FIDs.csv:* FID (family)/ Surname lookup table.
  * *FID:* Unique ID key assigned to each family.
  * *Surname:* Family Name corresponding to FID key.
  
* *FIW_RIDs.csv:* Relationship lookup table with keys [1-9] assigned to relationship types.

* *FIDs/*
  * *FID####/* Contains labels and cropped facial images for members of family (1-1000)
    * *MID#/:* Face images of family member with ID key <N>, i.e., MID #.
    * *F####.csv:* File containing member information of each family:
      * *relationships matrix:* representation of relationships.
      * *name:* First name of family member.
      * *gender:* gender of family member.
      
      
For example:

```
FID0001.csv
    
	MID     1     2     3     Name    Gender
	 1      0     4     5     name1     F
	 2      1     0     1     name2     F
	 3      5     4     0     name3     M
	
```

Here we have 3 family members, as listed under the MID column (far-left). Each MID reads acorss its row.


We can see that MID1 is related to MID2 by 4->1 (Parent->Sibling), which of course can be viewed as the inverse, i.e., MID2->MID1 is 1->4. It can also be seen that MID1 and MID3 are Spouses of one another, i.e., 5->5. And so on, and so forth.

<div class="AbstractExpand" id="ABSfiwpamiSI2018" style="display: none;">Recognizing Families In the Wild (RFIW): an annual large-scale, multi-track automatic kinship recognition evaluation that supports various visual kin-based problems on scales much higher than ever before. Organized in conjunction with the 15th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) as a Challenge, RFIW provides a platform for publishing original work and the gathering of experts for a discussion of the next steps. This paper summarizes the supported tasks (i.e., kinship verification, tri-subject verification, and search & retrieval of missing children) in the evaluation protocols, which include the practical motivation, technical background, data splits, metrics, and benchmark results. Furthermore, top submissions (i.e., leader-board stats) are listed and reviewed as a high-level analysis on the state of the problem. In the end, the purpose of this paper is to describe the 2020 RFIW challenge, end-to-end, along with forecasts in promising future directions.</div>

We present the largest database for visual kinship recognition, _Families In the Wild_ (FIW), with over 13,000 family photos of 1,000 family trees with 4-to-38 members. It took only a small team to build FIW with efficient labeling tools and work-flow. To extend FIW, we further improved upon this process with a novel semi-automatic labeling scheme that used annotated faces and unlabeled text metadata to discover labels, which were then used, along with existing FIW data, for the proposed clustering algorithm that generated label proposals for all newly added data-- both processes are shared and compared in depth, showing great savings in time and human input required. Essentially, the clustering algorithm proposed is semi-supervised and uses labeled data to produce more accurate clusters. We statistically compare FIW to related datasets, which unarguably shows enormous gains in overall size and amount of information encapsulated in the labels. We benchmark two tasks, kinship verification and family classification, at scales incomparably larger than ever before. Pre-trained CNN models fine-tuned on FIW outscores other conventional methods and achieved state-of-the-art on the renowned KinWild datasets. We also measure human performance on kinship recognition and compare to a fine-tuned CNN.

We present the largest kinship recognition dataset to date, Families in the Wild (FIW). Motivated by the lack of a single, unified dataset for kinship recognition, we aim to provide a dataset that captivates the interest of the research community. With only a small team, we were able to collect, organize, and label over 10,000 family photos of 1,000 families with our annotation tool designed to mark complex hierarchical relationships and local label information in a quick and efficient manner. We include several benchmarks for two image-based tasks, kinship verification and family recognition. For this, we incorporate several visual features and metric learning methods as baselines. Also, we demonstrate that a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an off-the-shelf feature extractor outperforms the other fea- ture types. Then, results were further boosted by fine-tuning two deep CNNs on FIW data: (1) for kinship verification, a triplet loss function was learned on top of the network of pre-train weights; (2) for family recognition, a family-specific softmax classifier was added to the network.
